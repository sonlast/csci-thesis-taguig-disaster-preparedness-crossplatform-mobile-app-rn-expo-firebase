            The country typically experiences an average of 20 tropical cyclones
            per year, with most of them occurring between June and November.
            This period is commonly referred to as the typhoon season.

            Tropical cyclones form over warm ocean waters when the sea surface
            temperature is at least 26.5 degrees Celsius (80 degrees
