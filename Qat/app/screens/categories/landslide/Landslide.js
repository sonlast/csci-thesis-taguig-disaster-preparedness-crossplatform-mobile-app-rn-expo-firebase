            originate when the forces acting on a slope exceed the strength of
            the materials holding it together. This can happen through a variety
            of mechanisms, including:
            {`\n`}
            {`\n`}
            1. Slope Saturation: When heavy rainfall saturates the soil, it
            increases its weight and reduces its shear strength, making it more
            prone to sliding.
            {`\n`}
            {`\n`}
            2. Erosion: Continuous erosion by rivers or surface runoff can
            undercut the base of a slope, leading to instability.
            {`\n`}
            {`\n`}
            3. Earthquakes: The shaking from seismic events can induce slope
            failure by altering the balance of forces within the slope material.
            {`\n`}
            {`\n`}
            4. Human Disturbance: Excavation, deforestation, and other human
            activities can remove vegetation or alter the natural slope,
            contributing to instability.
